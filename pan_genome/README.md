#### 1. download ortholog groups generated by orthomcl from 
#### https://figshare.com/articles/Tempo_and_mode_of_genome_evolution_in_the_budding_yeast_subphylum/5854692.
This was done by script ```linux download_ortholog_groups.sh ```
#### 2. visualize the gene occurence. Meaning that the percentage of genomes in a ortholog group out of all 
#### genomes. The corresponding code could be found in
