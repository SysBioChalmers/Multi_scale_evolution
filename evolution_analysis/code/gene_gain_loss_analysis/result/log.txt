 ---------------------- THE PARAMETERS ----------------------------
Likelihood computation is performed while acounting for un-oberved data
With min number of presences('1's)= 1
With min number of absences('0's)= 0
'Reversible'(Root.freq==stationary.freq) model is used
RootFreq EQ stationary (taken from each sp - gain/(gain+loss) )

gain , loss ~ Gamma(Alpha,Beta) 
gain - a Gamma prior distribution with: 3 categories
loss - a Gamma prior distribution with: 3 categories
Optimization of the model parmeters is performed
branch lengths optimization is performed using 'BBL-EM'
rate4site is calculated 
gain and loss 4site are calculated 
calculePosteriorExpectationOfChange is done Analytically
